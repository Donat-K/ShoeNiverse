		<h1 style="font-size:20px; margin-left: 40px;"><u>General  Inquiries</u></h1>
		<button class="accordion">How is ShoeNiverse different from other footwear retailers?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Since 2017, ShoeNiverse has been the most trusted source for buying and selling the rarest and 
		  most coveted sneakers. Our consignment marketplace is the most hassle-free process for independent 
		  sellers looking to move their inventory. And with ShoeNiverse, you don’t need to camp outside the 
		  stores or stay connected to the Internet for raffles, lotteries or RSVP alerts. There are no preorders
		  or reservations. As long as the item is in stock, all customers are empowered with the same 
		  opportunity to acquire everything they want.<br><br>
		  
		  From limited editions to unworn vintage sneakers, ShoeNiverse has fresh pairs of your must-haves and 
		  your sneaker grails. We pride ourselves on our ability to connect you to the consignors with the 
		  inventory you want.</p>
		</div>

		<button class="accordion">Are all products that ShoeNiverse sells new and authentic?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Everything is guaranteed authentic and new. We only accept sneakers in brand new and unworn 
		  condition for consignment.<br><br>

		  We do not sell, accept, or otherwise deal with fakes, "grey market" items, or factory variants. All 
		  sneakers we accept for sale are carefully and thoroughly inspected for condition and authenticity at 
		  multiple checkpoints before they're offered to customers. The staff is trained to identify any and 
		  all inconsistencies, and our policy is to decline items that don't meet our standards.</p>
		</div>

		<button class="accordion">Are the news articles about the sneaker community new?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Yes, every news article and new posts you see are recent news or information that has been buzzing
		  in the sneaker community.<br><br>
		  
		  We have a very well trained and educated staff that keep a passion in the there sneaker and 
		  hypebeast knowledge. Our staff is always ontop of there work and are always aware of the new release
		  dates that may have been posted for upcoming sneaker releases or other streetwear brands that have may
		  collabrated with high end sneakerr companies. Thats why SneakerBox is not only a leading site for sneaker
		  shopping but also one of the leaders in provding our customers and all the snekerheads across the world 
		  with new rumor and reports about whats happening at this very moment in the community.</p>
		</div>
		
		<button class="accordion">Where are you based?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>The ShoeNiverse head office is in Surrey, BC, Canada. We handle everything in the web shop from Vancouver.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h1 style="font-size:20px; margin-left: 40px;"><u>ORDER ADMINISTRATION</u></h1>
		<button class="accordion">I need to make changes to or cancel my order. Can you help me?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Unfortunately, our system does not allow us to make changes to an order (size, quantity, style, 
		  etc.) once your order has been placed. Since our entire inventory is independently owned, we may not 
		  have another shoe available in an alternate size or color for the same price.<br><br> 

		  In addition, once your order has been submitted to our shipping department for fulfillment, we are 
		  not able to honor requests for cancellations. Please confirm the details of your order carefully 
		  before submitting.</p>
		</div>

		<button class="accordion">How are the sizes listed?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Size is a personal preference so we are not able to make recommendations on fit. However, please 
		  note that all sizes on our site are in US sizing. In addition, you can differentiate between mens, 
		  womens, kids and children’s sizing with the following keys:<br><br> 

		  Womens shoes are denoted with a “w” in front of the size. For example, a w7.5 would be a women’s 
		  US size 7.5.<br><br>

		  Kids sizes are unisex and kids styles are noted with the following codes in the style name:<br> 
		  BG– Boys Grade-School<br>
		  GG - Girls Grade-School<br>
		  GS – Grade-School<br>
		  In addition, kids sizes are noted with a "Y." A 4Y would be a kids size 4 in US sizing.<br><br>

		  Infant, toddler and preschool shoes are noted with the following codes in the style name:<br> 
		  TD - Toddler<br>
		  PS - Pre-School<br>
		  C - Children<br>
		  Infant sizes are also noted with a "C." An 11C would be an infant size 11 in US sizing.</p>
		</div>

		<button class="accordion">I am having a hard time checking out. Can you help me?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>We are sorry to hear you are not able to place an order. If you are unable to complete the 
		  checkout process, our system will give you an error message. We find that most customers are entering 
		  a shipping address that is not the billing address associated with their credit card. Please verify 
		  that the information you are entering matches what your bank has on file.</p>
		</div>
		
		<button class="accordion">My order hasn’t arrived, what do I do?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Contact us at ShoeNiverse@ShoeNiverse.com and use your order number as subject and we’ll look into it as 
		  soon as we can.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h1 style="font-size:20px; margin-left: 40px;"><u>RETURNS</u></h1>
		<button class="accordion">What is the return policy?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>All sales at ShoeNiverse are final. In the event of a fulfillment error, please contact customer 
		  support and we will be happy to assist you. However, all ShoeNiverse merchandise is shipped with a 
		  ShoeNiverse hang tag attached. All shoes are inspected prior to shipment for order accuracy and 
		  defects such as yellowing, scuffs and stains beyond normal retail wear. ShoeNiverse will not honor 
		  any claims for incorrect or damaged items once this tag is removed.</p>
		</div>

		<button class="accordion">Why can't I return or exchange sneakers?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Since we operate entirely on consignment, and often with limited inventory, we’re unable to 
		  accept returns or issue refunds. All sales with us are final.</p>
		</div>

		
		<h1 style="font-size:20px; margin-left: 40px;"><u>DELIVERY</u></h1>
		<button class="accordion">When will my order arrive?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>We only want the best for our SneakerBox customers and want to process your orders as quickly as 
		  possible. In light of this, your items may arrive in separate packages. You can expect your package 
		  to arrive within 1-2 week for domestic addresses and 2-3 weeks for international addresses. Please 
		  note that due to unforeseen circumstances – international customs delays, weather delays, etc. – these
		  timelines are approximate. Once your order ships, you will receive a notification from our shipping 
		  partner with an estimated delivery date.<br><br>

		  Please note, we do not provide expedited shipping. If you need your order by a specific date, please 
		  contact customer service before placing your order. We can let you know if delivery by your required 
		  date would be possible.</p>
		</div>

		<button class="accordion">Can I ship to an address other than my billing address?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Yes, you can send your order to another address other than your billing address.<br><br>  

		  Just enter the card's billing address in the first column, and on the bottom of the checkout page, 
		  if you want to ship your order to another location, select the "Ship to different address" option 
		  and the secondary field will appear for you to enter your preferred destination. </p>
		</div>

		<button class="accordion">Will a signature be required when my package is delivered?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>In general, it is up to the discretion of the delivery driver to leave a package unattended and in a safe 
		  place. If you're unavailable during standard delivery times for your local carrier, you can contact them 
		  directly once your package ships to arrange for a pick-up at your local delivery center. We do not allow our 
		  packages to be re-routed to an alternate address once they have been shipped.</p>
		</div>
		
		<button class="accordion">Are customs and duties included in the shipping fee for international orders?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>No. For all international orders, customs and duties due will be billed to you upon delivery of your package.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h1 style="font-size:20px; margin-left: 40px;"><u>PAYMENT</u></h1>
		<button class="accordion">How do I pay for the products?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>We accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express, and Paypal. Please note that some American and 
		  Canadian card companies can have a block against foreign purchases and what you have to do then is to just 
		  tell them to remove it.</p>
		</div>

		<button class="accordion">The payment doesn't go through?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>Due to security reasons your card must be issued in the same country as you place the order from and the 
		  shipping address must also be in that same country.</p>
		</div>

		<button class="accordion">Why was my order canceled?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>There are various reasons for an order being canceled. However, we will notify you in the event that your 
		  order cannot be fulfilled along with the reason. Please note: we do reserve the right to refuse or cancel 
		  any order, for any reason, at our sole discretion.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h1 style="font-size:20px; margin-left: 40px;"><u></u>Contact Information</h1>
		<button class="accordion">I'm a current consignor or interested in selling shoes. Where can I get more information?</button>
		<div class="panel">

		  conatct us for details. For consignors, please contact the consignment team at ShoeNiverse@ShoeNiverse.com.
